# Resources on Causal Inference
"Correlation is not Causation." But when is association causation? How do we deal with observational data when the randomization of treatment is not possible? These questions have motivated me to spend this summer diving deep into the causal inference literature. Here are some of the resources that I found useful if you are interested in this topic.
